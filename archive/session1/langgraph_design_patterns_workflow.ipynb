        "\n",
        "**LangGraph** is a powerful framework built on top of **LangChain** that helps developers design **stateful, multi-step AI applications** using **graph-based workflows**.\n",
        "\n",
        "Instead of writing sequential chains or complex agents manually, LangGraph allows us to represent LLM logic as a **graph of nodes** — where:\n",
        "- Each **node** represents a computation or decision step.\n",
        "- **Edges** define how data flows between nodes.\n",
        "- The entire graph maintains **state** throughout the conversation.\n",
        "\n",
        "Think of LangGraph as:\n",
        "> \"A framework that brings deterministic control to agentic workflows powered by LLMs.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "It blends the flexibility of traditional agents with the **reliability and observability** of a flow-based architecture.\n",

        "### 🧭 Example 1: Simple RAG Workflow\n",
        "A basic Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) graph can have three nodes:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Query Analyzer Node** – decides if the question needs retrieval.  \n",
        "2. **Retriever Node** – fetches documents from the vector store.  \n",
        "3. **Answer Generator Node** – uses the LLM to synthesize an answer.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Flow:**  \n",
        "User Query ➜ Query Analyzer ➜ Retriever ➜ Answer Generator ➜ Response\n",
        "\n",
        "This gives fine control: if a query doesn’t need retrieval, the graph can skip the retriever step.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### 🧩 Example 2: FAQ Chatbot with Guardrails\n",
        "For a PDF FAQ bot:\n",
        "- **Input Node:** takes user question.  \n",
        "- **Retriever Node:** fetches relevant chunks from the document.  \n",
        "- **Answer Node:** LLM generates a summary answer.  \n",
        "- **Verifier Node:** double-checks if the answer is grounded in source documents.  \n",
        "- **Fallback Node:** returns “I’m not sure” if confidence < threshold.\n",
        "\n",
        "This ensures reliability and factual accuracy.\n",
